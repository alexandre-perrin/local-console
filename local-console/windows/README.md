# Alternative management of the Local Console CLI+GUI for Windows

Follow this procedure in case your Windows installation rejects the executable installer (e.g. Windows Defender throws a virus false-positive or unsigned installers are disallowed).

## Installing

Prior to starting, make sure you have either cloned the [local-console repository](https://github.com/midokura/local-console) or you have unpacked a source tarball into your machine. We shall refer to its location at `$local_console_repository_root`. Now, open a PowerShell window at that location and proceed with the steps below:

1. First, set the shell at the location of this README, and allow execution of the helper script for this step:
```powershell
> cd $local_console_repository_root\local-console\windows
> Unblock-File -Path .\install.ps1
```

2. Then, enable executing local scripts only for the current shell. You may be asked to confirm the action.
```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): Y
```

2. Execute the installer script. It will download all prerequisites, install them, and then install the CLI+GUI from the repository root.
```powershell
> .\install.ps1

> .\install.ps1

```

3. The script created a shortcut icon at your Windows desktop. Please click on it, and if asked allow network connections through the Windows firewall. You are now ready to use the GUI.

## Uninstalling

Just repeat the same procedure as above, but targeting the `uninstall.ps1` script instead of `install.ps1`. The script will remove the desktop shortcut and all files within your user's `%APPDATA%` folder. System dependencies such as Git, Mosquitto and Python 3.11 will remain installed. Should you want to remove them, you'll need to do so manually.
